= DS2Win Fusion v0.82 - June 12, 2008 =

DS2Win Fusion is a program designed to allow you to do ALL the things you could do with your PC, harnessing the
wireless capabilities and touch screen for maximum usability. Play movies, games and browse the net, check emails,
the sky is the limit! All you need is a windows PC and a wireless router or card.

This is an customized build of the Win2DS client and server, both the client and server have been enhanced
to provide new features, higher speed and service quality.

Note: This release will need to be DLDI patched before using (unless you have a R4DS like me and its done automatically)

If you have trouble getting this to work PLEASE read the readme.txt file included very carefully and follow the instructions.

Enjoy!
